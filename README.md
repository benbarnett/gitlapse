# GitLapse

Time lapse the design of your project. Will generate screenshots within a given range of commits, and run your setup script between each one to ensure the dependencies are always inline.

##Â Example usage

To run the example, ensure you have cloned the repo with submodules, as the tests rely on a seperate repo to ensure we're checking out revisions correctly.

Once you've done that, you can hit the following:

```sh
./bin/gitlapse --start-commit=932ad002c1d98b9704efed2f860f1a6e1a7b0e9d --end-commit=513b6013019185fd968b29db0058daf2215c8064 --repo="./test/fixtures/gitlapse-test"
```
